Download the source file from [*Compile Hadleyâ€™s Advanced R to a PDF*](http://brettklamer.com/diversions/statistical/compile-hadleys-advanced-r-programming-to-a-pdf/). Install R Package dependencies using `devtools::install_github("hadley/sloop")` and `devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")`. Finanlly, use `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::pdf_book")` to compile the book.

First of all, upgrade RStudio and installed packages to the latest version. During the building process, I've met several problems, most of them are package missing. The followings are the errors I've met and how I solved them. 


## "xelatex" not Found

According to the reference [*TinyTex*](https://yihui.name/tinytex/#for-r-users)(The lowercase *tinytex* means the R package, and the camel-case *TinyTeX* means the *LaTeX* distribution). Use *tinytex* to install *TinyTex* might fix the problem, but I still got other problems. In the end, I used *MiKTeX* instead.
Be careful, choose "*Always install missing packages on-the-fly*" when *MiKTeX* let you choose whether missing packages are to be installed.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/MiKTeX.png")
```

## 'make' not Found

After installed *Rtools*, I received this warning *In system(cmd) : 'make' not found*. To solve this problem, I added a path in the system settings as the picture shown below.
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/path.png")
```


## Missing Packages

Most of the warnings are packages missing. Use `install.packages()` to solve this kind of problem. The packages I installed during the process are *bookdown*, *lobstr*, *DBI*, *lobstr*, *bench*, *dbplyr*, *tinytex*, etc.


## Fonts

I installed two fonts, *Inconsolata* and *AndaleMono*, to get the code worked properly. These two fonts are not packages in R, they should be installed on the computer.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/fonts.png")
```

Like I mentioned above, I didn't compile the PDF using *TinyTex*. After installed *TinyTex*, the warning messages "*Package fontspec Error: The font "Inconsolata" cannot be found*" shown up. This error still exists after I installed the font. So, in the end, I used *MiKTeX* instead of *TinyTex*.
